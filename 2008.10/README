Going to Tokyo.

In the morning, I took the first plane to Tokyo.

For lunch I met with someone from the Nikkei business paper at Suidobashi.  It was about my involvement with ET2008*.

Basically, it seems like I will be talking about open source and other things like that.

After that, I went through Akihabara to IPA.

It was meeting for the open source contributor's prize selection committee.  It happens every year, but I it's always tough.  The policy seems to be that we evaluate businesses that contribute to open source software, but don't evaluate indivudual developers.

This happens every year too, but sentimentally, 4 people started to cry when they were not just runner ups.  Someone from the first nominated team refused the prize, so we gave it to the runner ups, but this wasn't made public.

PS.

Here is the announcement
