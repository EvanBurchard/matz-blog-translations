The good news- Matz has a blog that he regularly updates!  It's at-- http://www.rubyist.net/~matz/  
The bad news- It's in Japanese... and no one appears to be translating it, at least on git hub.  The posts are usually short, so I think I can give it a shot.  


Disclaimer:

It might be best to take this as "what Matz is talking about," rather than "what Matz actually said."  I'm not a Japanese expert, so I will go beyond saying that I don't guarantee it to be perfect.  Actually, I assure you that some of the things that I write I assure you will be WRONG WRONG WRONG.  Nonetheless, I think you might still be able to get some interesting info from my guesswork/translation.

If you want to read more about what is enjoyable/hard about these translations, you can check out my blog post about it at http://hobomage.blogspot.com/2008/12/translation.html.
