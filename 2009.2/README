Papa

It's kind of embarrassing to be called "papa", so from my first child on, I always told my kids to call me "otousan".  So thanks to that, "otousan" and "okaasan" have been established as what our kids call my wife and I.  But my youngest is so obstinate that she insists on calling us "papa" and "mama".

It's embarrassing, so I keep telling her to stop.

But come to think of it, my younger daughter calls my brothers "papa" too.
