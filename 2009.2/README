MacBook Pro

This morning, before I went out, a package was delivered, my MacBook Pro.

Ruby Central sent it to me because they wanted me to beef up the support for OS X.  This is the first time I've owned a Mac.

So, for now here are my first impressions of it.

-Some things are easy to understand
-Some things are hard to understand
-Some things I don't understand

I had all of these experiences.  I'm not quite sure what to say, but I'll try to write it in a little more detail.

Easy to understand:

The hardware and software design are both awesome.

I got the feeling that even without using the manual, I could do almost everything I wanted.  

The touchpad was better than I thought.  The two finger scrolling is especially nice.  But it is a little tough to target a small area, so closing windows is a kind of difficult.  I guess I should use a shortcut.

Hard to understand:

Because the OS is based on Unix(specifically Linux), I thought it would be basically the same, but MacOS X is very different. 

It's tough to use the features that aren't for everyday use, but you could easily say this about Windows too.

But maybe if I use it for a while, I can get used to this stuff.

Things I didn't understand:

The sense of security that I've had from being able to read the source code isn't there.

Also, some of the subtle settings are lost on me.  If I want to change the "kotoeri" Japanese input method, what do I do?

Papa

It's kind of embarrassing to be called "papa", so from my first child on, I always told my kids to call me "otousan".  So thanks to that, "otousan" and "okaasan" have been established as what our kids call my wife and I.  But my youngest is so obstinate that she insists on calling us "papa" and "mama".

It's embarrassing, so I keep telling her to stop.

But come to think of it, my younger daughter calls my brothers "papa" too.
