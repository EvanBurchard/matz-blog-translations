Sapporo
It's cold.  It was below freezing, even in the middle of the day.  What do you call that?

Dinner
We went to a place called Susukinonoisokane*().  All of the Sapporo Rubyist group had a great time.  Afterwards, I met sumim for the first time.

For some reason Nagata from Junkudo, who I met at RubyKaigi was there too.  Maybe to set up a branch store in Sapporo.

Anyways, food in Hokkaido is great.  So satisfying.  It's good that fast food never caught on here.

On the way home, I saw a snack bar called "Ruby" in the same building where we were.  

Then I remembered.  I don't know what year, but I'd be building before.  Maybe the same restaurant?  


*すすきのの磯金- maybe a restaurant called isokane, located in a town called susukino?

Japan is small

This morning, it's a ruby development meeting in Akihabara. Tonight, it's a visit to the Matsukou Institute to sing Christmas carols.  Tomorrow I go to Sapporo via Tokyo.

I really get the feeling that Japan is small.

SD Card

When I put the video from RubyConf on my 2 gig SD card, I got a read/write error. After that, the data was gone, and it would not mount.

It seems like the partition table is where the problem is.  fdisk is not returning a broken partition table error.

Maybe the card itself could be broken?  I don't rememeber being that rough with it though.
