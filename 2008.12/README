SD Card

When I put the video from RubyConf on my 2 gig SD card, I got a read/write error. After that, the data was gone, and it would not mount.

It seems like the partition table is where the problem is.  fdisk is not returning a broken partition table error.

Maybe the card itself could be broken?  I don't rememeber being that rough with it though.

Japan is small

This morning, it's a ruby development meeting in Akihabara. Tonight, it's a visit to the Matsukou Institute to sing Christmas carols.  Tomorrow I go to Sapporo via Tokyo.

I really get the feeling that Japan is small.
