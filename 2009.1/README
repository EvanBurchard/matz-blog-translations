Meeting the Governer

I am going to meet with Governer Mizoguchi of Shimane Prefecture to report on last year's activities of the Ruby Association.

We are also discussing what role the prefectural office could have in Ruby's development.

The Errand 

I was asked to go on an errand to buy some gyoza from the store.  But both shops in my neighborhood were on closed for New Year's.

So, against my better judgement, I made the gyoza with ingredients I had on hand.

I'm reflecting on it now.

But, I guess it was edible.
