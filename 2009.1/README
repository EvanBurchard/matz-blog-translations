Tons of snow

Just when I was thinking it got colder, we got a lot of snow.

So I had to shovel.  The house is on top of a hill, so if I don't shovel the snow, I can't get the car in and out.

That wore me out.

Breakfast

The kids started school today.

I overslept, so we didn't get to eat breakfast together.  Too bad.


Dinosaur Movie

My wife told my daughter that when her older brother goes home, let's watch the dinosaur movie.

But the "dinosaur movie" I borrowed from the video store is like Jurassic Park.  Won't that make the kid cry?

Meeting the Governer

I am going to meet with Governer Mizoguchi of Shimane Prefecture to report on last year's activities of the Ruby Association.

We are also discussing what role the prefectural office could have in Ruby's development.

The Errand 

I was asked to go on an errand to buy some gyoza from the store.  But both shops in my neighborhood were on closed for New Year's.

So, against my better judgement, I made the gyoza with ingredients I had on hand.

I'm reflecting on it now.

But, I guess it was edible.
