Spacebar

The X61's keyboard had junk in it, but when I cleaned it, the spacebar got disconnected.  I can't put it back the way it was.  I can solve a lot of problems and puzzles, but I am being bested by this spacebar.

What should I do?  Should I get the keyboard exchanged?

Things I should write about

It's hard to write my blog when I'm not into it.

I thought I'd just write the titles and leave it at that, so it's just titles.
-About the OSC-Joomla booth
-PND - PN100
-About all of the excellent sanyo things(ideas?) 
-RubyConf 2008 Conclusion
-The things that rails has taught me, the future of ruby

Fukuoka prefecture is taking applications for the Fukuoka big Ruby prize.

The people at the Fukuoka prefecture government office got in touch and paid a visit to the company.  

What to say about becoming the judging committee chairman.  Well, I wasn't at all reluctant to participate in the judging, but as chairman... wow.

Anyways, I did my best, but all of the other judges were so accomplished that they dwarfed me.

Went back to Japan
-It was a uneventful trip going back.  It's good to be home.
-I hate business trips.

Difference
After being out of Japan for a week
-It got cold
-The sunrise comes later
-The sunset comes earlier
Seems like winter.

I could not go to church.
I took a taxi to where the internet said that the closest church in the Buena Vista Ward was.  But it was not there.  There was a Sheraton hotel at that address.  I must have made some kind of mistake, but I do not know what.  What a shame.

Nice Try
(Matz's English)
At the QA session in RubyConf, when I stated "Nice Try" on Rubinius, everyone laughed loud. I was even shocked. I meant Rubinius to be a good attempt to reach ideal Ruby, but not there yet.

How sad to be a non native speaker.
