Title-Seems like I should write something.

It's hard to write my blog when I'm not into it.

I thought I'd just write the titles and leave it at that, so it's just titles.
-About the OSC-Joomla booth
-PND - PN100
-About all of the excellent sanyo things(ideas?) 
-RubyConf 2008 Conclusion
-The things that rails has taught me, the future of ruby

Title- Fukuoka prefecture is taking applications for the Fukuoka big Ruby prize.

The people at the Fukuoka prefecture government office got in touch and paid a visit to the company.  

What to say about becoming the judging committee chairman.  Well, I wasn't at all reluctant to participate in the judging, but as chairman... wow.

Anyways, I did my best, but all of the other judges were so famous, that they dwarfed me.

Went back to Japan
-It was a uneventful trip going back.  It's good to be home.
-I hate business trips.

Difference
After being out of Japan for a week
-It got cold
-The sunrise comes later
-The sunset comes earlier
Seems like winter.
